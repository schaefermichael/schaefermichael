## Hi there, I'm Michael 👋

#### 🏭 Work
I'm currently working for SAP. While I was hired as a DevOps Engineer, but I'm really more into the whole dev thing. Fullstack rules!

#### 👨‍🎓 Education
In parallel to my primary occupation, I'm a computer science M.Sc. student at DHBW CAS. I've already completed my B.Sc. in Business Information Technology at DHBW Karlsruhe in 2018.

#### 👨‍🔬 Skills
Currently working with SAP HANA, NodeJS (with Typescript) and Angular. Previous experiences include Python, ABAP, Java and C#. I also did PHP, jQuery and Visual Basic in the past, but that's not gonna be up-to-date anymore.
I'm currently playing around with different frontend libraries and frameworks (including React, Next.js and Nuxt.js) as well as serverless environments.
